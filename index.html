    <section id="about">
      <p>There is something beautiful about the circle of life. Everything on earth follows the patterns of the seasons, and I have always been drawn to spring. I was born with an innate fascination with mothering, infants, and biology. I knew I wanted to be a mother from the moment I was given my first Cabbage Patch doll (Leonard Asher). Once I discovered what jobs were, I knew I wanted to work with infants and mothers - first as a pediatrician, then as a midwife, then as a nurse, and for the last 5 years, as a practicing doula. This is my calling, and I am so grateful and honored that Iâ€™ve been able to do this work.</p>
      <p>I love babies and helping people through difficult situations. Being a doula has fit perfectly into my sense of self. After the birth of my first child at the tender age of 19, I knew then what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. However, bills and three more children require that I continue to have a day job. I am fortunate that my employer is aware of my doula work and is very supportive.</p>
      <p>Ten years ago, I began on my path for doula certification, and as of last year, I have received my official certification.</p>  
      <p>In order to make my services available to as many families as possible, I accept private insurance through Itsabelly and am able to accept OHP through Gateway Doulas. If your insurance plan does not cover a doula, we can discuss a sliding scale fee.</p>

        Birthing Care/Doula
      </h2>
      <p>
        During your birth, my primary goal is to maintain a balanced level of birthing hormones. This requires closely monitoring the birthing room to ensure a smooth delivery. Learn more about hormone interruption here [INSERT LINK HERE]. Prior to attending your birth, it is ideal for us to have five to six visits. These visits will help us become comfortable with each other and ensure that I am familiar with your needs in order to advocate for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can provide a space that meets your specific requirements. What is your pain management plan? Will you be using medications, such as an epidural, Lamaze, or Spinning Babies? Or are you planning to have a c-section? Whatever your choice may be, I will advocate for your wishes when you are unable to do so. In emergency situations, I remain calm and can assist with premature babies. Do I have any special certifications in premature care?

        Postpartum Care
      </h2>
      <p>
        Delivering a baby is hard work, but that is only the beginning of a challenging era of your life.
      </p>
      <p>
        What to expect for your first visit: Every baby is unique, and as such, I will spend our first visit getting to know your baby and their special and unique needs. I will also observe how your family supports each other and bring that to your baby's care.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will address any questions you have and provide assistance where needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the things you might expect (these are some examples):
        <ul>
          <li>
            Light housekeeping
          </li>
          <li>
            Laundry
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to focus on what I can do to make your space happy and safe for you.
